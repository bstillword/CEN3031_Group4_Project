# CEN3031_Group4_Project

Meta Colorful Knowledge is an educational software that will bring
informative news and facts in an easily digestible, visually stimulating format for a wide
range of users tailored to their unique interests. It is well documented and widely proved how
society spends most of their time on social media and has led to a prevailing trend of
isolation. That is why our software, Meta Colorful Knowledge, does not intend to alienate or
separate individuals through technology but to redirect them to a brighter mindset. We want
our users to find worth and purpose while they browse on the internet. Meta Colorful
knowledge, based on our userâ€™s research, will promote non-profit institutions, charities,
scientific studies, humanitarian organizations, and many other social entities that carry out
any beneficial projects for human society development.

The plan is to have a positive, strong social impact on communities by closing the
disconnections between users and their surroundings. This product will try to migrate
consumers from other social media platforms to an app that provides them information on
how to become tremendously useful to their families, local communities, and the greater
world through a focus on uplifting users rather than instilling despair.
